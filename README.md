# GraphMixerNetworks

> *In this model, we try to use MLP-Mixer in Graph Neural Networks. The motivation for this project is to replace Transformers and Message Passing with MLP-Mixers in Graph Neural Nets*

## Overview

* ```mixer.py```: **MLP-Mixer Layer** for Graph Mixer Networks
* ```layers.py```: **Graph Mixer Layer** 
* ```models.py```: **Graph Mixer Network**
* ```utils.py```: **Evaluation Metrics** and **Data Loading**
* ```train.py```: **Training Graph Mixer Networks**

## Usage
```bash
python train.py
```
